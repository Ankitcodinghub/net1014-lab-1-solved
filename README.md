MANUAL 1

Networking is at the heart of the digital transformation. The network is essential to many business functions today, including business critical data and operations, cybersecurity, and so much more. A wide variety of career paths rely on the network‚Äîso it‚Äôs important to understand what the network can do, how it operates, and how to protect it.

This is a great course for developers, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists, and other professionals looking to broaden their networking domain knowledge. It‚Äôs also an excellent launching point for students pursuing a wide range of career pathways‚Äîfrom cybersecurity to software development to business and more.

You‚Äôll learn these core skills:

‚Ä¢ Plan and install a home or small business network using wireless technology, then connect it to the Internet.

‚Ä¢ Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills using Cisco Packet Tracer.

‚Ä¢ Practice verifying and troubleshooting network and Internet connectivity.

‚Ä¢ Recognize and mitigate security threats to a home network.

These Lab Manuals provide you with all the labs and packet tracer activity instructions from the course designed as hands-on practice to develop critical thinking and complex problem-solving skills.

Lab Instructions:

1. Attendance at all labs is mandatory.

2. Sharing of ‚Äúcheck-in code‚Äù or checking without attending the lab is strictly prohibited.

Lab 1 ‚Äì Part A ‚Äì My Local Network

Objectives

ÔÅñ Record all the different network attached devices in your home or classroom.

ÔÅñ Investigate how each device connects to the network to send and receive information. ÔÅñ Create a diagram showing the topology of your network.

ÔÅñ Label each device with its function within the network.

Background / Scenario

The path that a message takes from its source to destination can be as simple as a single cable connecting one computer to another or as complex as a network that literally spans the globe. The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components:

1. End devices

2. Intermediary network devices

3. Network media

Instructions

Your Local Network

Manufacturer Device Location Connection Media

Samsung Galaxy S23+ Mobile Wireless Wifi &amp; cell phone

Google Home mini My room Wireless Wifi

Govee RGB light strip My room Wireless Wifi

Tp-Link Deco wireless router Living room Wired Ethernet cable

Samsung Galaxy buds Mobile Wireless Wifi

Sony PS4 Living room Wireless Wifi

Continue the list on a separate page if necessary.

Reflection

1. Are there other electronic devices that are not connected to the local network to share information or resources? What would be the benefit of having these devices online?

Smart cooker. Connecting the smart cooker to the home network allows all family members to access built-in recipes on the smart cooker to assist in the cooking process.

2. Which type of connectivity is used most frequently in your local network, wired or wireless?

Wireless.

3. Draw a diagram of your local network. Label each device with a name and location.

Lab 1 ‚Äì Part B ‚Äì Determine the IP Address Configuration of a Computer

Objectives

Required Resources

‚Ä¢ Network access

Instructions

Part B.1: Determine the IP Address Using the Command Prompt

Step 1: Verify network access.

a. Open a web browser.

b. Navigate to any website, such as www.netacad.com.

Step 2: The command ipconfig.

The ipconfig (ifconfig on Mac) command provides you with the IP address, subnet mask and default gateway.

a. Click Start. Search for Command Prompt. Double-click to open a Command Prompt. (shortcut Windows key + R, then type in cmd).

C:UsersStudent&gt; ipconfig

Questions:

What is the IPv4 address of the computer?

172.20.29.253

What is the subnet mask of the computer?

255.255.128.0

What is the default gateway of the computer?

172.20.0.1

Step 3: The command ipconfig /all.

a. At the prompt, enter ipconfig /all command to view IP configuration on your PC.

C:UsersStudent&gt; ipconfig /all

Questions:

What are the DNS servers for the computer?

172.18.41.14 172.18.41.15

What is the MAC address (physical address) of the network adapter?

78-2B-46-4C-F4-C3

Is DHCP enabled? If yes, what is the IP address of the DHCP server?

Yes. 172.18.41.14

Part B.2: Test the Network Interface TCP/IP Stack

Step 1: Test TCP/IP stack using the loopback address.

To verify that the TCP/IP protocol is functioning, ping your loopback address (127.0.0.1). Enter the ping 127.0.0.1 command at the prompt.

C:UsersStudent&gt; ping 127.0.0.1

Step 2: Test TCP/IP stack using the configured IP address.

You can also ping your IP address. In this example, enter the ping 192.168.1.11 command at the prompt.

Question:

Record one of the replies from your ping command.

Pinging 127.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:
